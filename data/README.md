# Data Directory README

## Overview
The `data` directory houses the datasets for various ethical frameworks. Each ethical framework has its own subdirectory containing relevant files. The details of each file are outlined in our research paper. For a comprehensive understanding, please refer to Appendix A of the paper.

## Subdirectories
The `data` directory contains the following subdirectories:

1. **care_ethics**
2. **deontology**
3. **utilitarianism**
4. **virtue_ethics**

Each subdirectory contains the following files:

- `actions-broad.txt`
- `actions.txt`
- `edit-templates-broad.txt`
- `edit-templates.txt`
- `entries-broad.json`
- `entries.json`

## File Descriptions

Here is a brief overview of the purpose of each file:

`actions.txt: Contains a list of actions specific to the ethical framework.
`actions-broad.txt`: A broader set of actions with a more extensive scope.
`edit-templates.txt`: Templates for editing entries related to the ethical framework.
`edit-templates-broad.txt`: A broader set of edit templates.
`entries.json`: The primary dataset file containing the larger subset of data for the ethical framework.
`entries-broad.json`: A smaller subset of the dataset, containing 30 examples, useful for quick reference or initial exploration.
