# CounterMoral

Welcome to the CounterMoral repository, which houses the datasets and code for a research project focused on editing moral judgments in language models. This project evaluates how current model editing techniques can modify moral judgments within diverse ethical frameworks, aiming to better align models with human values.

## Project Overview

Recent advancements have greatly enhanced the capability of language models, particularly in editing factual information. However, the modification of moral judgments remains a critical yet underexplored area for aligning models with human values. CounterMoral introduces a novel dataset designed to evaluate the efficacy of various model editing techniques across four ethical frameworks: Deontology, Care Ethics, Virtue Ethics, and Utilitarianism.

### Key Features
- **Comprehensive Dataset:** Includes the CounterMoral dataset tailored for assessing modifications of moral judgments in language models.
- **Ethical Frameworks:** Focuses on Deontology, Care Ethics, Virtue Ethics, and Utilitarianism.
- **Model Editing Techniques Evaluation:** Applies and evaluates multiple editing techniques across different language models.

### Dataset Structure

Data entries are organized under the `data/` directory, following the structure `data/{framework}/(entries|entries-broad).json` where `{framework}` represents one of the ethical frameworks mentioned above.

### Example Data Entry (Deontology)

## Repository Structure

- **`/config`:** Configuration files and global settings.
- **`/data`:** Contains the datasets split by ethical framework.
- **`/evaluations`:** Scripts and modules for running evaluations on the model editing techniques.
- **`/src`:** Core source code for generating the dataset using the OpenAI API
- **`/tests`:** Test scripts.

## Getting Started

To get started with CounterMoral, follow these steps:

 **1. Clone the repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/MichaelRipa/countermoral.git
```

 **2. Set up Environment (assuming Conda):**

```
conda create -n CounterMoral python=3.8
conda activate CounterMoral
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

 **3. Run Evaluations:**
Navigate to the root of the project and run:

```
python3 -m evaluations.run_evaluations --all
```

## Extending and Generating Data

For researchers interested in generating additional ethical edit examples or supporting new ethical frameworks, the `src` directory contains scripts utilizing the OpenAI API for these purposes. Detailed instructions on how to use these scripts are provided in the `src` README.
