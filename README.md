# CounterMoral

This repository contains the datasets and code for the research project on editing moral judgments in language models. The goal of this project is to assess how well current model editing techniques modify moral judgments across diverse ethical frameworks, aiming to align models with human values.

**Note:** This is an ongoing research project currently in the process of being wrapped up for publication. The repository is actively being worked on and updated. We appreciate your understanding and welcome any feedback or contributions.

## Introduction

Recent advancements in language model technology have significantly enhanced the ability to edit factual information. Yet, the modification of moral judgments—a crucial aspect of aligning models with human values—has garnered less attention.In this work, we introduce CounterMoral, a novel dataset crafted to assess how well current model editing techniques modify moral judgments across diverse ethical frameworks. We apply various editing techniques to multiple language models and evaluate their performance. Our findings illuminate significant insights and challenges, paving the way for future research in developing ethically aligned language models.

This repository includes the COUNTERMORAL dataset, specifically designed to evaluate the modification of moral judgments in language models across four ethical frameworks: Deontology, Care Ethics, Virtue Ethics, and Utilitarianism.

### Dataset Structure

The data entries are stored in the `data/{framework}/(entries|entries-broad).json` format, where `framework` is one of `deontology`, `care ethics`, `utilitarianism`, and `virtue ethics`.
